         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Chief Iuſtice of the Common Pleas for the time being, and with good and ſufficient Sureties to be by him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, to bear the whole charges of the new Survey, and over and above to pay and ſatisfie unto the Defendant or Defendants his and their full Damages and Coſts which they ſhall ſuſtain by ſuch proſecution, and ſhall offer to make Oath of before the ſaid Lord Chief Iuſtice, in caſe that upon the return of ſuch ſurvey, it ſhall not appear that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant or Defendants againſt whom ſuch new Survey is ordered, were poſſeſt of more land by a full tenth part than he or they ought to have.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Where any new Survey is ordered, the ſame ſhall be taken by two Surveyors to be choſen for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, one by the Informer, the other by the Defendants, and both Surveyors ſhall be ſworn.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Where the Books of Diſtribution and the Down Survey agree in the ſatisfactions, which have been allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any Regiments, Troops, Societies or perſons, or do not differ more than in one tenth, there no reſurvey ſhall be ordered, notwithſtanding ſuch information.</p>

            <p>Seventhly, If the overplus exceed a tenth, it ſhall be lawful to and for ſuch Defendant or Defendants poſſeſſed of the overplus, to retrench the ſame where they think fit, ſo as ſuch Retrenchments be contiguous, and of unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble land, together with the profitable, but is hereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of all accompts for the Meaſn profits of the landes ſo retrenched.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, If the information of falſe admeaſurement be againſt a Souldier, or his Heirs or Aſſigns, there the lot of the whole Regiment, Troop or Company ſhall be firſt ſurveyed, and if the ſame exceed not one tenth part of what ſuch Regiment, Troop or Company ought to have, then no ſurvey ſhall be taken of any individual lot or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>

            <p>Eleaventhly, No defendant or defendants whoſe lotts are not to be found within the books of diſtribution, books of debentures, or books of <hi>Grocers-Hall,</hi> ſhall be liable to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new ſurvey or readmeaſurent, his evidences being loſt.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly and laſtly, All proceedings in order to a new Survey or readmeaſurement which ſhall not be finiſhed and perfected within nine monthes next after paſſing this Act ſhall ceaſe and be void and the defendant to be diſcharged of all ſuch inquiries for concealments upon ſuch informations.</p>
